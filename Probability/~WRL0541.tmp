Probability is the likelihood of an event occurring. 
This event can anything. We measure probability with numeric values between 0 and 1, because we like to compare the relative
likelihood of events.

Probability Formula:
• The Probability of event X occurring equals the number of preferred outcomes over the number of outcomes in the
sample space.
• Preferred outcomes are the outcomes we want to occur or the outcomes we are interested in. We also call refer to such
outcomes as “Favorable”.
• Sample space refers to all possible outcomes that can occur. Its “size” indicates the amount of elements in it.
If two events are independent:
The probability of them occurring simultaneously equals the product of them occurring on their own.
P(A B) = P(A) . P(B)
